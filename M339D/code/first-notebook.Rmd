# Big Title 

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including `R`-chunks
Here we include an `R`-chunk. The keyboard shortcuts are:

- On a Mac: command+option+i
- In Windows: control+alt+i

```{r}
2+3
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Tiny title
This is how you *emphasize* things!

This is even more **prominent**!

Lists are easy:

- Item #1
- Item #2

Here's a formula $\sin(\pi)=0$. 

Here's a formula display

\[
\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{x}\, dx = \infty
\]

Here's another

$$
\ln\left(\frac{S(0)}{K}\right)
$$

Subscripts: $x_1, x_2, \dots$
