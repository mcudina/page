## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#simple addition
5+6
```

This produces a six-number summary of a data set:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Lists:

- item #1
- item #2

Here is a formula display:

\[
\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{x}\, dx = \infty
\]

Here's another:

$$
\ln\left(\frac{S(0)}{K}\right)
$$
Within the text, I can write $x_1, ..., x_n$ ...
