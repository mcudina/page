Let the continuously compounded, risk-free interest rate be $0.04$. 


Consider a stock whose current price is \$100 and whose volatility is $0.25$. We will be pricing a one-year, \$95-strike call option. 


## Problem #1: Analytic Black-Scholes
Price the option above using the Black-Scholes pricing formula. 

*Solution:*

## Problem #2: Black-Scholes Monte Carlo with $Z$
Provide the *Monte Carlo* estimate of the price using the simulated draws from the standard normal distribution with 10000 simulations.

*Solution:*


## Problem #3: Black-Scholes Monte Carlo with `rlnorm``
Provide the *Monte Carlo* estimate of the price using the simulated draws from the lognormal distribution with 10000 simulations.

*Solution:*
