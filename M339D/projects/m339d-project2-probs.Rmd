## Problem #1 (25 points)
Your initial wealth is exactly \$100. You are allowed to invest in
shares of a particular stock. You are also allowed to both lend and
borrow at the continuously compounded risk-free interest rate of
0.05. Keeping your money uninvested is **not allowed**.

You can rebalance your portfolio every morning, once you have observed
the opening stock price. This means that you can change the number of
shares you own (if you decide to do so) and accordingly adapt your
risk-free investment.

You proceed to create a ``rule'' according to which you will be
rebalancing your portfolio. Here is a possible rule you can use:

*If the stock price drops overnight (regardless of the extent of the
  drop), sell half of the stock investment. If the stock price rises
  overnight (regardless of the extent of the increase), double the
  amount of the stock investment. If the stock price does not change, do
  nothing. In all three cases, the rest of my wealth is to be invested
  at the risk-free rate (if needed, I will borrow at the continuously
  compounded risk-free interest rate).*

Over the following 10 days, you observe the following stock prices for a non-dividend-paying stock:

\medskip

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
{\bf Day} & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\
\hline
{\bf Stock price} &100 & 80 & 64 & 80 & 64 & 80 & 100 & 80 & 64 & 80 & 100 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\medskip

As the time passes you follow investment rules above to rebalance your portfolio. Complete the following table describing your portfolio \textbf{just before and just after} the rebalancing is done. 
Even more precisely, for the $10$ days, both for "morning" and "evening" print out:

* the number of shares of stock in the portfolio, 
* the balance of the risk-free investment, 
* the wealth in the stock, 
* the total wealth. 


## Problem #2 (25 points)
Repeat the above problem with **your own rule** based on *technical analysis*, i.e., the study of past prices. Explain why you designed the rule the way you did and why you believe it would prove to be a successful investment strategy. Provide references if you have any.

## Problem #3 (25 points)
### The Dow index and Dow futures
Please, in no particular order read the Wikipedia entry about *futures contracts* and listen to the fun and educational episode of *Planet money* about credit risk in cafeteria futures. Both are linked below:

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract): Futures

[Planet money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/01/06/462149561/episode-15-delicious-cake-futures): Delicious cake futures

**(10 points)** Provide the definitions of the forward contract and the futures contract. Then, highlight the similarities and the differences between the two. 

The files "dow.csv" and "dow-futures.csv" contain index prices and the futures prices for delivery on a particular date in the future. 

**(5 points)**
Import the data into a data frame (or two?). Draw the time-plot of the evolution of the closing index prices and the futures prices on the same coordinate system. You do **not** need to put the calendar days on the horizontal axis, but you **do** need to label your axes and give your time-plot a title indicating the dates. Make sure that you plot the two trajectories in **different** colors indicating in the text which color corresponds to which company. 

Here is a link to a straightforward tutorial which will help you accomplish the above neatly: 

[Timeline plotting](https://statisticsglobe.com/draw-multiple-time-series-in-same-plot-in-r) 

**(10 points)**
What do you notice when you compare the timeplots? Which of the formulae for calculating futures prices you encountered on the Wikipedia entry come in handy?


## Problem #4 (25 points)
### Apple calls
The file "apple-calls.csv" contains call prices observed on February 14th for European call options on the stocks of Apple Inc with expiry on May 19th and with varying strike prices. 

**(5 points)**
Import the data into a data frame. Create a line plot of the mid price (defined as the midpoint between the bid and the ask price) as it depends on the strike. 

**(5 points)**
What do you notice about the monotonicity and convexity of the above curve? 

**(15 points)**
Show that the same conclusions regarding the monotonicity and convexity of the call prices with respect to the strike must hold in general **under the no arbitrage assumption**.
