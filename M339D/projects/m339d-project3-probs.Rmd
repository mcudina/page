Before you start working on this project, watch the following two videos about simple linear regression couretsy of OpenCourse Statistics:

[Ideas of fitting a line](https://youtu.be/mPvtZhdPBhQ)

[Fitting a least-squares regression line](https://youtu.be/z8DmwG2G4Qc)

Next, keep this tutorial on *simple linear regression* in `R` handy

[Simple Linear Regression in `R`](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/07/how-to-do-a-simple-linear-regression-in-r/)

## Problem #1 **(20 points)**
Download the data set with information about the cricket chirps per second and the temperature available in Canvas. 

**(5 points)** What plot would you provide to visualize the association between the frequency of cricket chirps and the temperature? Plot it and comment on at least **three** relevant features of the data. 

**(2 points)** If you were to provide a single value quantifying the *strength* of the relationship, what would it be? Calculate that value. 

**(5 points)** Which trend curve (if any) would you use for the association you visualized? 

**(3 points)** Imagine that you are in the situation where someone tells you they hear $18$ chirps per second, at which temperature would you say it was?

**(5 points)** If you had been asked to provide the same temperature "prediction" for the given value of $10$ chirps per second, what would you say?


## Problem 2. (40 points)
The data set `mfm.csv` is available in Canvas. Download it and import it into `R`. Identify the names of the columns. 

The immediately relevant columns are `mktrf`, `rf`, and `wmt`. They contain the daily excess return of the market, the Treasury return (a proxy for the risk-free interest rate), and the daily returns of *Walmart*, respectively. 

**(10 points)** In the context of CAPM, provide an appropriate visualization of the relationship between excess returns of the market and the excess returns of *Walmart*. Comment on at least three features of the plot you obtain. 

**(20 points)** Estimate the daily *beta* of *Walmart* based on the above information. More precisely, provide the entire `summary` of your model and, then, emphasize the estimated value of the *beta*. 

**(10 points)** 
Go through the following tutorial on the meaning and construction of **prediction intervals** in `R`. 

[Prediction intervals](http://www.r-tutor.com/elementary-statistics/simple-linear-regression/prediction-interval-linear-regression)

On 2022/08/31, the excess return of the market was $-0.0074$, and the Treasury return was $0.00008$. By CAPM, what is the **prediction interval** of the return of *Walmart* on 2022/08/31? 

Your instructor calculated the *Walmart* return for that date as $0.0005283816$. Do you have any comments/conclusions that you would like to share?


## Problem 3. (20 points)
Read the following articles. 

[An article on familiarity bias.](http://bogan.dyson.cornell.edu/doc/Hartford/Bogan-6_Familiarity.pdf) 

[Familiarity breeds investment.](https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/1554/Huberman-familiarity-breeds.investment.pdf) 

[Wikipedia: Overconfidence effect.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overconfidence_effect) 

[Wikipedia: Disposition effect.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposition_effect) 

[Investopedia: Herd behavior.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/herdinstinct.asp) 

**(10 points)** 
Do the above behaviors agree with the assumptions of CAPM? Why? Justify your answer. 

**(10 points)** 
Which of the above behaviors would result in a *systematic bias*, i.e., which of the above behaviors would "push" the security prices away from their fundamental value? Substantiate your response. 

## Problem 5. (10 points)
Consult the following Wikipedia page: 

[Fama-French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famaâ€“French_three-factor_model)

Explain in a short paragraph what modifications to the CAPM model result in the Fama-French model. Which statistical tool would you have to use to estimate the parameters in this model? Look back at the data set `mfm.csv`. Do the names of the columns look familiar now? 

## Problem 6. (10 points)
Read the following article:

[Beyond Multi-Factor Models](https://mbrjournal.com/2021/01/26/the-cost-of-capital-if-not-the-capm-then-what/)

Write a paragraph or two discussing the pros and cons of CAPM (and its kin, i.e., multi-factor models).
