## Problem #1 (25 points)
Assume the **Black-Scholes model**.
The continuously compounded, risk-free interest rate is $0.06.$ Let the current stock price of a non-dividend-paying stock be \$100. Let its volatility be $0.25$. 

**(5 points)** 
Simulate 1000 values of the stock price at time $t=3$. 
Draw a histogram of the obtained set of values.  

**(6 points)** 
Superimpose the graph of the density of a lognormal distribution of $S(3)$ with the appropriate parameters onto the histogram obtained above. The command `dlnorm` should come in handy.  

**(2 points)** 
Find the median of the set of simulated values you obtained above.

**(2 points)** 
Find the mean of the set of simulated values you obtained above.

**(2 points)**
What is the proportion of stock prices you 
created in this way that above \$105? 

**(5 points)** 
What is the theoretical risk-neutral probability that the final asset price exceeds \$105?

**(3 points)** 
Comment on the comparison between the proportion and the risk-neutral probability you obtained above. Which theorem from probability is useful here?


## Problem #2 (25 points)
Let the continuously compounded, risk-free interest rate be $0.05$. 

Consider a stock whose current price is \$120 and whose volatility is $0.20$. We will be pricing a three-month, \$115-strike call option. 

### Part a: Analytic Black-Scholes (5 points)
Price the option above using the Black-Scholes pricing formula. 


### Part b: Black-Scholes Monte Carlo with $Z$ (10 points)
Provide the *Monte Carlo* estimate of the price using the simulated draws from the standard normal distribution with 10000 simulations.



### Part c: Black-Scholes Monte Carlo with `rlnorm`` (10 points)
Provide the *Monte Carlo* estimate of the price using the simulated draws from the lognormal distribution with 10000 simulations.



## Problem #3 (25 points)
Let the continuously compounded, risk-free interest rate be $0.03$. 


Consider a stock whose current price is \$90 and whose volatility is $0.30$. We will be pricing a half-year, \$95-strike put option. 

### Part a: Analytic Black-Scholes (5 points)
Price the option above using the Black-Scholes pricing formula. 


### Part b: Black-Scholes Monte Carlo with $Z$ (10 points)
Provide the *Monte Carlo* estimate of the price using the simulated draws from the standard normal distribution with 10000 simulations.



### Part c: Black-Scholes Monte Carlo with `rlnorm`` (10 points)
Provide the *Monte Carlo* estimate of the price using the simulated draws from the lognormal distribution with 10000 simulations.



## Problem #4 (25 points)
Let the continuously compounded, risk-free interest rate be $0.04$. 

Consider a stock whose volatility is $0.25$. 

**(5 points)** First, we will be focusing on a one-year, \$100-strike European call option. Define a function which calculates the analytic Black-Scholes price of this call as a function of the initial asset price denoted by $s$. Then, plot the graph of that function. Let the domain of your plot be $[0,200]$. 


**(10 points)** 
Now, plot the graph of the above Black-Scholes price (as a function of the underlying stock price) one year, half a year, quarter year and a week prior to exercise date. Add the plot of the payoff function. Let the domain of your plot be $[50,150]$. Make sure that all the plots are in different colors. What do you notice as the exercise date approaches? What can you say about the call delta?

**(10 points)** 
Repeat the previous problem for an otherwise identical put option.
