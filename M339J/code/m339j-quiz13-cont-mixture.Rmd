# Simulations
## Problem 1.  (15 points)
Consider the following two-step experiment. First you draw a the value of the mixing parameter $\Lambda$ from a uniform distribution on $[0,20]$. Then, you draw the simulated value from an exponential distribution with mean $\Lambda$. 

**(7 points)** Repeat the above two-step experiment $10000$ times and draw the histogram of the simulated values. 

**(2 points)**
Find the theoretical mean of the above distribution and compare it to the mean of the simulated values. 


**(6 points)**
Find the theoretical variance of the above distribution and compare it to the variance of the simulated values.
