## Seat Position 

We reconsider the **seat position** data set. Recall that it is from the `faraway` library. 

```{r}
#install.packages("faraway")
library(faraway)
```

The data set `seatpos` is used to predict the carseat position (`hipcenter`) based on biometric data of the driver. 

```{r}
data(seatpos)
```

This is what we got when we tried multiple linear regression.

```{r}
lm.fit=lm(hipcenter~.,data=seatpos)
summary(lm.fit)
```

Does PCA help? Let's import the requisite library. 

```{r}
library(stats)
```

I will reimagine my predictor variables to be the ones with the biometric data (so, we exclude `Age` and the response).

```{r}
data=seatpos[,2:8]
attach(data)
```
