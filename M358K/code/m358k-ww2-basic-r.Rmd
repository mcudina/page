Create an `R`-notebook which prints out the answers to the following problems. All of your work and calculations **must** be done in `R`.

# Arithmetic 
## Problem 1. 
Multiply 7 by 21. 

## Problem 2. 
Find the square root of $\pi$

## Problem 3. 

## Problem 4. 
Find the fourth root of 1024.

## Problem 5. 
Calculate the natural logarithm of 5.

# Variables and vectors
## Problem 6.  
Assign the value 2 to variable `a` and  the value 3 to variable `b`; print out their ratio

## Problem 7.
Set the vector `v` to be the numbers between -1 and 8 (inclusive); set the vector `w` to be the first 10 natural numbers; what do you get when you multiply `v` by `w`?

# Loops
## Problem 8. 
Write and execute a chunk of code which calculates and prints out the sum of squares of the first $n$ natural numbers for $n=1, 2, \dots, 25$.
