## Problem 3. **(5 points)**
*Source: AMC8, 2019.*

The diagram shows the number of students at soccer practice each weekday during last week. After computing the mean and median values, Coach discovers that there were actually $21$ participants on Wednesday. 
```{r, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("amc-8.png")
```
Which of the following statements describes the change in the mean and median after the correction is made? *Why?*

a. The mean increases by $1$ and the median does not change.
b. The mean increases by $1$ and the median increases by $1$.
c. The mean increases by $1$ and the median increases by $5$.
d. The mean increases by $5$ and the median increases by $1$.
e. The mean increases by $5$ and the median increases by $5$.

a. 
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c}
Min. & Q1 & Median  &  Mean & Q3 & Max. \\
3.00 & 7.75  &  9.50  &  9.95  & 12.00 &  19.00\\ 
\end{tabular}
