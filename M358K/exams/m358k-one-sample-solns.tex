\begin{problem} ($20$ points) %fall 2011 and FINAL -- Spring 2012
Four balls are drawn (without replacement) from a box which contains
$4$ black and $5$ red
balls. Given that the four drawn balls were {\em not} all of
the same color, what is the probability that there were exactly two
balls of each color among the four. 
\end{problem}

\sol{ 
Let $A$ denote the event that the colors of
the balls drawn are not all the same, and let $B$ denote the event
that there are exactly two black balls and two red balls. We are
looking for $\PP[B|A]$. Since $B\subseteq A$, we have
\[ \PP[B|A]=\PP[B\cap A]/\PP[A]=\PP[B]/\PP[A].\]
To compute $\PP[A]$, we note that the event $A^c$ consists of only two
elementary outcomes: either all balls are black or all balls are red. 
The probability of picking all red balls is 
\[ \frac{\binom{5}{4}}{ \binom{9}{4}} \]
while the probability of picking all black balls is
\[ \frac{\binom{4}{4}}{\binom{9}{4}}=\frac{1}{\binom{9}{4}}. \]
Putting these two together, we obtain
\[ \PP[A]= 1-\frac{\binom{5}{4}+1}{\binom{9}{4}}.\]
To compute $\PP[B]$ we note that we can choose $2$ red balls out of 
$5$ in $\binom{5}{2}$ ways and, then, for each such choice, we have
$\binom{4}{2}$ ways of choosing $2$ black balls from the set of 4 
black balls. Therefore,
\[ \PP[B] = \left( \binom{5}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \right) \Big/
\binom{9}{4}.\]
Finally,
\[ \PP[B|A] = \frac{ \binom{5}{2} \binom{4}{2} }{ \binom{9}{4} -
\binom{5}{4} - 1 }= \frac{ 10 \times 6}{ 126 - 5 - 1}= \frac{1}{2}.\]

\begin{problem} ($15$ points)%fall 2011 and FINAL -- Spring 2012
Consider a set-up in which a transmitter is transmitting either a $0$
or a $1$ and the receiver indicates that it received either a $0$ or a
$1$. Denote the events that $i =0,1$ was transmitted by $T_i$, and the
events that $i=0,1$ was indicated as received by $R_i$. \\
It is possible to have transmission errors. In fact, you are given the
following data on accuracy and the frequency of transmitted signals: 
\begin{equation}%\label{}
    \nonumber 
    \begin{split}
      \PP[R_0 \, | \, T_0] = 0.99,  \ 
    \PP[R_1 \, | \, T_1] = 0.98,

there was an error in the transmission?

  R_1|T_0]\PP[T_0] + \PP[R_1|T_1] \PP[T_1]}\\
  &= \frac{ (1-0.99) \times
  0.75}{ (1-0.99) \times 0.75 + 0.98 \times 0.25}\\ &=
  \frac{3}{101}\cong 0.030.
 \end{split}
\end{equation}
\item An error will happen if $T_0\cap R_1$ or $T_1\cap R_0$ occur,
  i.e.,
   \begin{equation}\nonumber
    \begin{split}
    \PP[\text{error}]&=\PP[ T_0\cap R_1]+ \PP[ T_1\cap R_0]\\ &=
  \PP[R_1|T_0] \times \PP[T_0] + \PP[ R_0|T_1] \times \PP[T_1]\\
  &= (1-\PP[R_0|T_0]) \times \PP[T_0]\\ & \qquad + (1-\PP[ R_1|T_1]) \times
  (1-\PP[T_0]) \\
  &= 0.01 \times 0.75 + 0.02 \times 0.25 \\ &

  A final exam consists of multiple choice problems -- each problem
  with $5$ offered answers only one of which is correct.  Before the
  final exam the diligent student is given a practice set of multiple
  choice problems. Knowing that exactly 70\% of the final exam will be
  out of the practice set, the student works out the entire practice
  set and gets the correct answer to each question. 

When he takes the final exam, the student proceeds to answer the known
questions correctly. However, for the remaining questions, he panics
and chooses the answers completely at random.

{\em Source: Sample P exam problem set.}

An insurance company pays hospital claims. 

The number of claims that include emergency room or operating room charges is 85\% of the total number of hospital claims. 

The number of claims that do not include emergency room charges is 25\% of the total number of claims. 

The occurrences of emergency room charges and operating room charges are independent. 

Calculate the probability that a claim submitted to the insurance company includes operating room charges.

\item[(a)] 0.1

\item[(b)] 0.2

\item[(c)] 0.25

\item[(d)] 0.4

\item[(e)] None of the above
\end{itemize}
\end{problem}

\sol{{\bf (d)}\\
Let us denote by $E$ the event that a given claim includes emergency room charges and 
by $O$ the event that it includes operating room charges. Then, we can formalize the data provided in the problem as 
\begin{equation}%\label{}
    \nonumber 
    \begin{split}
      \PP[E \cup O] & = 0.85\\
      \PP[E^c] & = 0.25 \, \Rightarrow \, \PP[E] = 0.75\\
      \PP[E \cap O] & = \PP[E] \PP[O]. 
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
We need to find $\PP[O]$. 

From the first equality above, we get 
\begin{equation}%\label{}
    \nonumber 
    \begin{split}
      0.85 = \PP[E \cup O] = \PP[E] + \PP[O] - \PP[E \cap O]. 
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Then, using the second qnd third equalities,  
\begin{equation}%\label{}
    \nonumber 
    \begin{split}
        0.85 = \PP[E \cup O] = 0.75 + \PP[O] - 0.75 \PP[O]. 
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
So, $\PP[O] = 0.1 /0.25 = 0.4.$
