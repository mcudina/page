## Problem 1. **(5 points)**
Consider the following histogram:
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("hist.png")

```

The histogram is ...

a. unimodal.
b. bimodal, symmetric.
c. bimodal, asymmetric.
d. trimodal.
e. uniform. 

*Why?*

*Solution:*
The correct answer is **c.**
There are two modes at around $0$ and at around $8$. There is a long tail on the right-hand side (notice the observations at around $30$) while there is not a long tail on the left-hand side. 

## Problem 2. **(5 points)**
*Source: AMC8, 2019.*

The diagram shows the number of students at soccer practice each weekday during last week. After computing the mean and median values, Coach discovers that there were actually $21$ participants on Wednesday. 
```{r, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("amc-8.png")
```
Which of the following statements describes the change in the mean and median after the correction is made? *Why?*

a. The mean increases by $1$ and the median does not change.
b. The mean increases by $1$ and the median increases by $1$.
c. The mean increases by $1$ and the median increases by $5$.
d. The mean increases by $5$ and the median increases by $1$.
e. The mean increases by $5$ and the median increases by $5$.

*Solution:*
The correct answers is **b.**
The sum of the number of students increased by $5$ with the correction (from $16$ to $21$ on Wednesday. So the average increased by $5/5 = 1$. As for the median, the old data set was $16, 16, 20, 22, 26$ and the median was $20.$ Now, the data set is, in increasing order: $16, 20, 21, 22, 26$. So, the new median is $21$; an increase of $1$. 

## Problem 3. **(5 points)**
Consider the following box plot:
```{r, out.width="80%"}

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c}
Min. & Q1 & Median  &  Mean & Q3 & Max. \\
3.00 & 7.75  &  9.50  &  9.95  & 12.00 &  19.00\\ 
\end{tabular}
b. 
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c}
Min. & Q1 & Median  &  Mean & Q3 & Max. \\
3.00 & 7.75  &  9.50  &  9.95  & 12.00 &  17.00\\ 
\end{tabular}
c. 
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c}
Min. & Q1 & Median  &  Mean & Q3 & Max. \\
0.00 & 7.75  &  8.00  &  9.95  & 12.00 &  17.00\\ 
\end{tabular}
d. 
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c}
Min. & Q1 & Median  &  Mean & Q3 & Max. \\
3.00 & 7.75  &  9.50  &  9.95  & 10.00 &  17.00\\ 
\end{tabular}
e. None of the above.

*Solution:*
The correct answer is **a.**

## Problem 4. **(5 points)**
Consider the following stacked dotplot:
```{r, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("stacked.png")
```
Which summary statistics does it correspond to?

a. 
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c}
Min. & 1st Qu. &  Median  &  Mean & 3rd Qu. &   Max. \\
   10.00  & 14.50 &  23.00  & 20.31 &  25.00  & 28.00  \\  
\end{tabular}
b. 
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c}

8.00  &  14.50  &  23.00  &  20.31  &  25.00  &  28.00 \\  
\end{tabular}
c. 
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c}
Min. & 1st Qu. &  Median  &  Mean & 3rd Qu. &   Max. \\
8.00  &  14.50  &  23.00   & 20.31  &  25.00   & 30.00 \\  
\end{tabular}
d. 
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c}
Min. & 1st Qu. &  Median  &  Mean & 3rd Qu. &   Max. \\
8.00  &  14.50  &  25.00  &  20.31  &  25.00  &  28.00 \\  
\end{tabular}
e. None of the above.

*Solution:*
The correct answer is **b.**

## Problem 5. **(5 points)**
Find the probability of obtaining exactly two fives in six rolls of a
fair die.

a. $5^5/(2^3\cdot 3^6)$
b. $5^5/(2^6\cdot 3^6)$
c. $5^5/(2^6\cdot 3^5)$
d. $1/5$
e. None of the above

*Solution:*
The number of fives in six rolls of a die has the binomial
distribution with parameters $n=6$ and $p=1/6$. The probability of
getting exactly two fives is
\begin{equation}%\label{}
    \nonumber
    \begin{split}
      {6\choose2} \cdot \frac{1}{6^2}\cdot \frac{5^4}{6^4} = 3\cdot 5
      \cdot \frac{5^4}{6^6} = \frac{5^5}{2^6 \cdot 3^5}\,.
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

## Problem 6. **(25 points)**
 In Country X, the latest census has
 revealed the following:
 \begin{itemize}
   \item $40\%$ of the population exercise regularly,
   \item $30\%$ own a dog,
   \item $20\%$ like cauliflower,
   \item $60\%$ of all dog owners exercise regularly,
   \item $10\%$ own a dog and like cauliflower,
   \item $4\%$  exercise regularly, own
	 a dog and like cauliflower. 
 \end{itemize}
 \begin{enumerate}
   \item (5pts) Draw a Venn diagram and represent all the assumptions above
	 using probabilities and the set notation. 
   \item (10pts) A person is selected at random. Compute the probability that
   he/she is a dog owner who does not exercise regularly.
 \item (10pts) If it is known that the randomly selected person either likes
   cauliflower or owns a dog (or both), what is the probability that 
   he/she exercises regularly, owns a dog and likes cauliflower?
 \end{enumerate}

*Solution:*
Let $E$ denote the event that the person chosen exercises regularly,
$D$ that he/she owns a dog and $C$ that he/she likes cauliflower. 
The problem states that 
  \begin{align*}
	\mathbb{P}[ E|D]&=0.6,  &\mathbb{P}[C\cap D]&=0.1, &\mathbb{P}[C\cap D \cap
	  E]&=0.04,\\
	\mathbb{P}[E]&=0.4, &\mathbb{P}[D]&=0.3, &\mathbb{P}[C] &=0.2.
 \end{align*}
 
It follows that $\mathbb{P}[E\cap D]=\mathbb{P}[E|D]\times \mathbb{P}[D] = 0.6\times 0.3=0.18$,
so $\mathbb{P}[ D\cap E^c]=\mathbb{P}[D]-\mathbb{P}[E\cap D] = 0.12$. 

We are looking for $\mathbb{P}[E\cap C\cap D|C\cup D]=
  \mathbb{P}[ E\cap C\cap D]/\mathbb{P}[C\cup D]$. We know that $\mathbb{P}[C\cup
  D]=\mathbb{P}[C]+\mathbb{P}[D]-\mathbb{P}[C\cap D]= 0.2+0.3-0.1=0.4$, so 
  the required probability is $0.04/0.4=0.1$. 

## Problem 7. **(5 points)**
Three independent fair coins are tossed. Let 
\begin{equation}\nonumber
  \begin{split}
    E_1 & = \{\text{the outcome on coin \#1 matches the outcome on coin \#2}\}\\
    E_2 & = \{\text{the outcome on coin \#2 matches the outcome on coin \#3}\}\\
    E_3 & = \{\text{the outcome on coin \#3 matches the outcome on coin \#1}\}\\
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Which of the following statements is **not** correct?

a. $E_1, E_2$ and $E_3$ are independent.
b. $E_1$ and $E_2$ are independent.
c. $E_2$ and $E_3$ are independent.
d. $E_3$ and $E_1$ are independent.
e. $E_1$ and $E_3$ are independent.

*Solution:*
The correct answer is **a.**

## Problem 8. **(5 points)**
The local pool supply store is having an end-of-season sale. They have a seemingly infinite number of floaties lying around. They know that among those $1/4$ are ancient floaties from seasons past (so, old) and that $3/4$ are the last season's floaties (so, new). We know that 15\% of old floaties leak, and that 5\% of new floaties leak. When an order comes in, a floatie is chosen at random to fulfill the order. You are excited about the sale and you are the first one to show up at the door. You buy a floatie. You take it to the pool. It does not leak. What's the probability that it was a new floatie?

a. About 0.77
b. About 0.79 
c. About 0.85
d. About 0.87
e. None of the above.

*Solution:*
This probability tree describes the situation in the problem:

```{r, out.width="120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("tree-floatie.png")
```

We use the Bayes' theorem here.
\begin{equation}\nonumber
  \begin{split}
    \mathbb{P}[ N \, |\, \text{floatie does not leak}] 
    =
    \frac{\mathbb{P}[ \text{floatie does not leak} \, |\, N]\mathbb{P}[N]}
    {\mathbb{P}[\text{floatie does not leak}]}\, . 
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Using our tree, we get
\begin{equation}\nonumber
  \begin{split}
    \mathbb{P}[\text{floatie does not leak}] = 0.25(0.85)+0.75(0.95) = 0.925.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
So, 
\begin{equation}\nonumber
  \begin{split}
    \mathbb{P}[ N \, |\, \text{floatie does not leak}] 
    =
    \frac{0.75(0.95)}{0.925} = 0.7703. 
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
